## About Me

I began working with large datasets in 2014. I had just graduated with a MSc in Business Psychology, was confident in my statistics and research skills and had a passion for learning about human behavior. I was hired as a product analyst for a gaming company, and that's where my journey in data analytics really began!

## Project Examples

In addition to the examples you see below, I'm familiar with visualizing data in Tableau, Microsoft Power BI and Mixpanel. I've also explored many other visualization products on my own and as evaluations for my employers.
