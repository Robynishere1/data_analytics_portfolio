## About Me

I began working with large datasets in 2014. I had just graduated with a MSc in Business Psychology, was confident in my statistics and research skills and had a passion for learning about human behavior. After a few data focused internships, I was hired as a player behavior analyst for a large gaming company, and that's where my journey in data analytics really began! I spent 5 years at that company learning SQL, PostgreSQL, R, and visualizations with Tableau. I now work remotely for an EdTech company, who I have assisted through their journey from building their first data platform to now having some data infrastructure in place that can be used for product analytics. In the meantime I've played an instrumental role in defining KPI's, data requirements, and data design. I've expanded my visual toolset to include Microsoft Power BI, Mixpanel and Splunk, and I've taken database design and python courses. I have a very practical and applicable approach to data analytics. 

## Project Examples
